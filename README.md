## Predicting the Severity of Major Power Outages in the U.S.
**Analysis by Pratham Aggarwal**

## Introduction
Power outages disrupt millions of lives, which raises pressing issues like public safety and emergency response to economic stability. A power outage may seem like a simple inconvenience—like losing the chance to finish a show on Netflix—but its real impact goes far beyond that. In severe situations, a power outage can disable critical medical equipment, shut down heating or cooling during extreme weather, interrupt communication systems used by first responders, halt transportation services, and cause widespread economic losses for businesses and communities.

Some of the major columns for the data and their descriptions are shown below. For descriptions of all other columns, please visit [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182).
<div style="overflow-x: auto;">

| Column                                  | Description |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| **dur_hours**                           | Duration of the power outage in hours (calculated from outage start and restoration times). |
| **customers.affected**                  | Number of customers impacted by the outage event. |
| **demand.loss.mw (megawatt)**           | Amount of electricity demand lost (in megawatts) during the outage. |
| **population**                          | Population of the state where the outage occurred. |
| **poppct_urban (%)**                    | Percent of the state population living in urban areas. |
| **res.price (cents/kWh)**               | Residential electricity price in cents per kilowatt-hour. |
| **pc.realgsp.state (usd)**              | Per-capita real gross state product (an economic indicator) in US dollars. |
</div>

Summary statistics of some variables that intuitively contribute most to the power outage are shown below.  
**Note:** `dur_hours` is calculated by taking the difference between `outage_restore` and `outage_start`.

To better understand these events, this project uses the [Major Power Outage Events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182) dataset, which records **1,535** power outages in the United States. Each outage has around **57** columns of information. This wide range of information motivates the central question of this project:  
**What factors influence how long a major power outage lasts, and can we predict outage duration using the available data?**

Understanding and predicting outage duration can help policymakers and the general public prepare for emergency needs, allocate resources effectively, and plan according to outage severity.

## Assessment of Missingness
Based on the dataset the column which is most likely to be **NMAR** (Not Missing at Random) is
`demand.loss (megawatt)` During large severe outages, reporting systems are often deprioritized which increases the likelihood that the larger (unobserved) values of outages are missing. This further means that missing may be directly related to the variable itself (the definition of NMAR).
To frame it as **MAR** (Missing at Random) further information on why the values are missing would be needed. This additional information could be wind speed, precipitation, some disaster report or reporting system failure is needed. If these factors can convey some correlation with the missingness in demand.loss (megawatt) then MAR can be justified.
