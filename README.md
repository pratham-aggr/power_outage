## Assessment of Missingness
Based on the dataset the column which is most likely to be **NMAR** (Not Missing at Random) is
`demand.loss (megawatt)` During large severe outages, reporting systems are often deprioritized which increases the likelihood that the larger (unobserved) values of outages are missing. This further means that missing may be directly related to the variable itself (the definition of NMAR).
To frame it as **MAR** (Missing at Random) further information on why the values are missing would be needed. This additional information could be wind speed, precipitation, some disaster report or reporting system failure is needed. If these factors can convey some correlation with the missingness in demand.loss (megawatt) then MAR can be justified.
